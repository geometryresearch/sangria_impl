# TODOs

## Didactic Variant

Folding scheme:
- one finite field, generic
- one additively homomorphic commitment scheme, Pedersen for generic field
- one arithmetization of pure PLONK, Matrix of field elements with three columns and $n+s+1$ rows
- one circuit-friendly hash function for fiat-shamir, Poseidon with parameters for the finite field

IVC: 
- one cycle of curves, Pasta
- one circuit friendly hash function, Poseidon with parameters for the scalar field of the primary curve
- one circuit of the folding verifier

Proof compression:
- one snark for relaxed Plonk arithmetization, (modified) Halo2
